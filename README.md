### Install
Add the unzipped folder using the 'unpacked extension' option to Chrome/Chromium extensions menu (after enabling Developer Mode), go to 'Install Add-on From File...' in the Firefox extensions menu and point it to the Firefox release zip file (you may need to set xpinstall.signatures.required to false in about:config to disable signature checks)

(The reason why this fork was made was because you couldn't set the instance manually in the Firefox version, only in the Chrome/Chromium version)
